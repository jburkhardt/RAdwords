Title: Loading Google Adwords Data into R
Description: Aims at loading Google Adwords data into R. Adwords is an online
    advertising service that enables advertisers to display advertising copy to web
    users (see <https://developers.google.com/adwords/> for more information). 
    Therefore the package implements three main features. First, the package
    provides an authentication process for R with the Google Adwords API (see 
    <https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/> for more information) via OAUTH2.
    Second, the package offers an interface to apply the Adwords query language in
    R and query the Adwords API with ad-hoc reports. Third, the received data are
    transformed into suitable data formats for further data processing and data
    analysis.
