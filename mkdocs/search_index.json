However your keywords are running in the google search and in the google content network at the same time.\n\n\nCannot get keywords\n\n\nSince AdWords API version 201601 the attribute name \nKeywordText\nis no longer valid. Use \nCriteria\ninstead.\n\n\nSend mutate jobs\n\n\nIs it possible to send mutate jobs wo the API?  \n\n\nNo it\u00b4s not.

Changing campaigns, keywords, AdWords settings, etc. is not possible with the package.\n\n\nList account IDs\n\n\nHow to list all AdWords account IDs which are in my MCC?\n\n\nWe would love to implement this feature! Unfortunately the Adwords API reporting service does not allow to query the account information on client center level.  \n\n\nHowever the good is, you only need to authenticate once in order to access all accounts within your MCC. Best practice is to create a vector containing the account IDs and loop over the vector.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n# authentication, once done you can access all accounts in your MCC\ngoogle_auth \n- doAuth()\n# specify date range, i.e. last two weeks until yesterday\nyesterday \n- Sys.Date()-1\ntwoWeeks \n- Sys.Date()-14\n# create statement\nbody \n- statement(select=c'Date','AccountDescriptiveName','CampaignName','Impressions','Clicks','Cost','Conversions'),\n                  report=\nCAMPAIGN_PERFORMANCE_REPORT\n,\n                  start=twoWeeks,\n                  end=yesterday)\n#vector of account IDs\naccounts \n- c(\nxxx-xxx-xxxx\n,#Account 1\n              \nxxx-xxx-xxxx\n,#Account 2\n              \nxxx-xxx-xxxx\n)#Account 3\n#loop over accounts and rbind data to dataframe\ndataList \n- list()\nfor(account in accounts){\n    dataList[account] \n- getData(clientCustomerId=account,statement=body,google_auth = google_auth)\n}\ndata \n- do.call(rbind, dataList)",

A commen case of this issue occures when you query competition metrics ( SearchRankLostImpressionShare ) which are only available for the google search.

Unfortunately the Adwords API reporting service does not allow to query the account information on client center level.
